Micro-Manage - Software Engineering Project Repository

Here we will posts all our code for the project. Using this repo will allow us to have a stable copy and provide a way for everyone to pull from so that we are all working on the same build.

This "Current" branch will be the current branch/version of our software. This will different from the "main" branch which will contain our latest stable build.
